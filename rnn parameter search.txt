increasing batch size seem to have worst result

all the search on lr and scheduler have been done with 20 samples batch
best lr around .00043 /2 at epoch60
more variability with less sample/batch but better results

10 batch size
.00043 lr
/2 at epoch 60
seems to have the best result for now

but need to try lowering batch size again and changing lr to see

or just changing lr again with new batch size of 10
