we designed an other simple model which take this time in input T0 as well as the coeficient alpha
(10 001 features)

we trained the model on 160 samples with containing  8 differents alpha coefs

we try after that to get the result from the nn for a T0 but with 2 alpha different (hard coded)
the first one is 0.004 (high) and the second is 0.0005 (low)
the result from the nn is the same in the two cases (map in up right corner is not relevant
