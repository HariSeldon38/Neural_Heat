we train a basic nn with a single hidden layer of size 1 000 (linear layers, one ReLU)
	we used 200 training samples

	loss (MSE of each pixels) at the end was : 0.000709
	precision (mean of all loss of the test samples): 3.8e-05

we then used the model on one of the sample of the full dataset (don't know if the sample was used for training or for computing accuracy)
the images are ok, we have the same image as the modelisation + a little noise but I consider this as pft
